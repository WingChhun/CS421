# Assignment

 - Design a context free grammar for all and only the strings of round and square parentheses that are balanced
 - Implement a parser that accepts strings of round and square parentheses that are balanced

 # Purpose
   - simulate a PDA to parse the sequences of correctly balanced round and square parentheses in C++


# How to Compile
 - Attached is a file called "pda.cpp" that contains the source code for the program
 - Navigate to a folder that contains this executable source code file using Putty. 
    - Optionally you can navigate to a folder, create a new cpp file and paste the source code
 - create a .txt file called "input.txt" and paste strings of round and square parentheses
- run 'g++ pda.cpp' or "g++ 'filename'", there should be no errors in Putty
- run the command './a.out' and the output will be displayed
