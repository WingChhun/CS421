( 2 ) review ( 2a ) # 1 - tufftest - lite - free pc diagnostics utility&nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; [ download @ www . ipcug . org ] &nbsp ; you arrive home with your new computer . sure , it hurt paying $ 1 , 800 , but you have it all - - large cardboard boxes , yards of cables , oceans of foam packing . assembly is a snap . as they told you in the store , every cable only fits one way . you follow all the instructions , turn it on and everything is perfect - you are very proud of yourself . &nbsp ; months later you start to experience mysterious problems and occasional system lock ups . probably some software tsr or driver has conflicted with windows again . as before , you spend endless hours trying to track it down , but this time to no avail . then one day , unfortunately just after the warranty runs out , it stops working . when you boot , you see a cryptic error message that says something about memory , or parity , or some such thing . &nbsp ; maybe you ' ll spend a lot of time swapping parts and playing with your computer 's insides - but if you do n't have the time or the skills , you ' ll lug the beast down to the repair shop and wait hours for their low-cost " instant " diagnostic service . then you ' ll pay " more " to get it fixed . it 's moments like these that you need # 1 - tufftest - lite . &nbsp ; # 1 - tufftest - lite by # 1-pc diagnostics company simply makes sure that your equipment is connected and working . before you set off on a software wild goose chase , # 1 - tufftest - lite blows the whistle on faulty hardware , in this case a bad memory simm in main memory . &nbsp ; sophisticated operating systems blur the line between hardware and software . when a program wants to access a drive , memory or port , windows manages the request . many test programs tell you that they are testing the hardware , but they can't really tell if the problem lies with the hardware , the software that controls it or windows . # 1 - tufftest - lite eliminates the problem by eliminating the complex operating system . &nbsp ; the program fits on a floppy disk and contains its own super slim operating system and device drivers . when it runs tests , nothing stands between them and the pc hardware . # 1 - tufftest - lite can directly attack drives , controllers , ports and memory , giving them a stiff workout and telling you whether they pass muster . &nbsp ; interestingly , this handy little utility reports fewer hardware faults than conventional diagnostic programs - - because it virtually eliminates the false positives that can be generated when software gets in the way . when it does report a problem with your equipment , you can be confident that it is worthwhile dismantling the system and making the trip back to the shop . when # 1 - tufftest - lite gives the all clear , it is sensible to assume that the issue is a software or setup one . &nbsp ; for the technically minded , # 1 - tufftest - lite runs a range of standard hardware checks . it starts with the motherboard and looks at the processor , math coprocessor , dma controller and real time clock . from there , it moves through a series of video and alignment and color tests , and onto the video adapter itself . after that , parallel and serial ports , floppy and hard drives and main memory are run through their paces . &nbsp ; one advantage of its small size is that # 1 - tufftest - lite automatically relocates from lower main memory to upper main memory and then back again on every pass . thus all of main memory is tested . no other diagnostics can do this because they have to occupy a large chunk of it themselves . after finishing with a check of extended memory , # 1 - tufftest - lite reports on your pc and its components . it produces a results display with a simple pass or fail for each component . if everything checks out , you have the satisfaction of knowing that your pc 's internals are a-ok . &nbsp ; the product does n't assume that you are technically minded . to run it , you turn off your pc , place the # 1 - tufftest - lite diskette in the floppy drive a and turn your pc on . the proprietary boot loader and operating system boots your pc and then automatically runs all the tests , with no user intervention if you like . the tests do n't alter any system settings , so even a novice can use it without fear of doing damage . return after 5-10 minutes and the report will be ready . &nbsp ; there is more to pc problem solving than a basic hardware check , but if you can't do that , you can spend a lot of time looking under the wrong rocks . &nbsp ; best of all , # 1 - tufftest - lite is freeware with no restrictions on its use or distribution so you really can't go wrong giving it a try .
